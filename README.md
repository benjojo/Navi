Navi
====

Navi is a program that sits on your computer that will constantly 
scan for bluetooth devices and constantly try and pair with them as
a polite way of telling them that their bluetooth is discoverable.

It loops though all the of the deivces it can see and will try to pair with them as
hard as it can, this is a good way to get them to stop making their bluetooth
discoverable.
